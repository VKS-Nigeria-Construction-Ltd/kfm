            <p>An industrial revolution is underway in Akwa Ibom State, spearheaded by Onur Kumral, a Turkish businessman and investor, who recently won the Independence Newspaper CEO of the Year in Nigeria.</p>

            <p>In this interview with Godwin Akpan, Mr Kumral speaks on manufacturing and business-related issues, including plans to export syringes from Nigeria to Germany.</p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Q: This is the very first time a non-Nigerian has been honoured as CEO of the year, during the 2020 Independence Award. This is outstanding. How did you arrive at this, what’s the secret?</p>

            <p>Onur Kumral: It’s our organisation that got the award. We get this as a people. I’m just getting this on behalf of them. First, I really want to thank my team, Akwa Ibom State, stakeholders, and the company, for their support. It (the award) came through hard work. Now, it is time for new frontiers. The secret is that we worked hard. We believe in this country. We believe that if we continue like this, we will get more.</p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Q: How are Akwa Ibom people benefiting from your investment in the state?</p>

            <p>Onur Kumral: Akwa Ibom State is one of the largest oil producing States in Nigeria. But unfortunately, in the past, the State could not record adequate investment. That is what we saw as a point of business. So, the things that we created have impacted much on manpower and also trade. When you have investments like the ones we have here, Jubilee Syringe Manufacturing Limited and Kings Flour Mill, you are simply creating jobs for the people.  ...<a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/features-and-interviews/479559-interview-were-opening-turkish-textile-industry-in-akwa-ibom-in-2022-md-vks-group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-secondary">readmore</a></p>
