            <p>Akpabio, who was elated with the level of work done at the project site said the Udom Emmanuel-led administration remains committed to the binding social contract of creating jobs for Akwa Ibom people through industrialization and creation of investment opportunities for the people as embedded in the governor’s Completion Agenda.</p>

            <p>Taking the Commissioner’s entourage around the facility, Project Manager of the facility, Mr. Alper Yilmaz, said Kings Flour Mill has a fixed production line to process flour and semolina and will on Thursday, 8th August 2019 commence a test-run to ascertain the level of readiness of the machines for adequate production. He added that Kings Flour Mill can produce 24,000 bags of wheat (500 metric tons) and 400 tons of flour daily.</p>

            <p>Speaking to newsmen briefly after the facility tour, the Commerce and Investment Boss, said Nigeria’s wheat production has been stagnant at 60,000 tonnes in the last three years and that with the commencement of production at Kings Flour Mill, the country is set to witness a boom in wheat production and this will surely have a positive impact not just on the nation’s economy but also on the state’s economy which is already waxing stronger due to the investment-friendly policies of the Governor Udom Emmanuel-led administration.</p>
